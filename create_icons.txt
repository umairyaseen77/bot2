ICON FILES NEEDED FOR EXTENSION:

You need to create these 3 icon files and place them in the extension folder:

1. icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
2. icon48.png (48x48 pixels)  
3. icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

SIMPLE SOLUTION:
- Use any image editor (Paint, GIMP, online editor)
- Create simple square images with "AJ" text (Amazon Jobs)
- Use blue/orange Amazon colors
- Save as PNG files with exact names above

OR DOWNLOAD:
- Find free job/search icons online
- Resize to required dimensions
- Save with exact filenames

The extension will work without icons but Chrome will show default placeholder icons.

QUICK OPTION - Use these as temporary placeholders:
- Right-click any web image
- Save as and rename to icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png
- Extension will load but use whatever images you saved
